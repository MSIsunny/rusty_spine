# rusty_spine

Spine runtime for Rust (and wasm!) transpiled from the official C Runtime. It is useable in two ways, either by [using the Spine C Runtime directly](https://github.com/jabuwu/rusty_spine/blob/main/examples/c.rs) or by using the provided Rust API. The Rust API is not stable and is likely to change a lot.
